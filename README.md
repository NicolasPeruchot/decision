## Structure of the repository

The repository contains a folder notebooks. The notebooks inside contains the code for our models and show our results visually. The notebook `calcul_planning.ipynb` is the one suggesting a planning solving the problem. The others are computing surfaces of non-dominating solutions.
In the folder data, you can find some instances of the optimisation problem.
You can find at the root the `instancegenerator.py` script that creates new instances.
